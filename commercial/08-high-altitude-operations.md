* CA.VIII.A.K2c c. Time of useful consciousness (TUC)
* CA.VIII.A.K3 Operational factors, including:
* CA.VIII.A.K3a a. Characteristics, limitations, and applicability of continuous flow, demand, and pressuredemand oxygen systems
* CA.VIII.A.K3b b. Differences between and identification of “aviator’s breathing oxygen” and other types of oxygen
* CA.VIII.A.K3c c. Precautions when using supplemental oxygen systems
### Risk Management
The applicant is able to identify, assess, and mitigate risk associated with:
* CA.VIII.A.R1 High altitude flight.
* CA.VIII.A.R2 Use of supplemental oxygen.
* CA.VIII.A.R3 Management of compressed gas containers.
* CA.VIII.A.R4 Combustion hazards in an oxygen-rich environment.
### Skills
The applicant exhibits the skill to:
* CA.VIII.A.S1 Determine the quantity of supplemental oxygen required in a scenario given by the evaluator.
* CA.VIII.A.S2 Operate or simulate operation of the installed or portable oxygen equipment in the airplane, if installed or available.
* CA.VIII.A.S3 Brief passengers on use of supplemental oxygen equipment in a scenario given by the evaluator.
* CA.VIII.A.S4 Use single-pilot resource management (SRM) or crew resource management (CRM), as appropriate.
## Task B. Pressurization
### References
AC 61-107; AIM; FAA-H-8083-2, FAA-H-8083-3, FAA-H-8083-25; POH/AFM
### Objective

* CA.VIII.B.K1 Fundamental concepts of aircraft pressurization system, including failure modes.
* CA.VIII.B.K2 Physiological factors, including:
* CA.VIII.B.K2a a. Impairment
* CA.VIII.B.K2b b. Symptoms of hypoxia
* CA.VIII.B.K2c c. Time of useful consciousness (TUC)
* CA.VIII.B.K2d d. Effects of rapid decompression on crew and passengers
### Risk Management
The applicant is able to identify, assess, and mitigate risk associated with:
* CA.VIII.B.R1 High altitude flight.
* CA.VIII.B.R2 Malfunction of pressurization system, if equipment is installed.
### Skills
The applicant exhibits the skill to:
* CA.VIII.B.S1 Operate the pressurization system, if equipment is installed.
* CA.VIII.B.S2 Respond appropriately to simulated pressurization malfunctions, if equipment is installed.
* CA.VIII.B.S3 Brief passengers on use of supplemental oxygen in the case of pressurization malfunction, if equipment is installed.
* CA.VIII.B.S4 Use single-pilot resource management (SRM) or crew resource management (CRM), as appropriate.
