* CA.VIII.A.K2c c. Time of useful consciousness (TUC)
* CA.VIII.A.K3 Operational factors, to include:
* CA.VIII.A.K3a a. Characteristics, limitations, and applicability of continuous flow, demand, and pressure-demand oxygen systems
* CA.VIII.A.K3b b. Differences between and identification of “aviator’s breathing oxygen” and other types of oxygen
* CA.VIII.A.K3c c. Necessary precautions when using supplemental oxygen systems
### Risk Management
The applicant demonstrates the ability to identify, assess and mitigate risks, encompassing:
* CA.VIII.A.R1 High altitude flight.
* CA.VIII.A.R2 Failure to use supplemental oxygen.
* CA.VIII.A.R3 Management of compressed gas containers.
* CA.VIII.A.R4 Combustion hazards in an oxygen-rich environment.
### Skills
