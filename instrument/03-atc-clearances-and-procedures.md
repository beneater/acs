# III. Air Traffic Control (ATC) Clearances and Procedures
## Task A. Compliance with Air Traffic Control Clearances
### References
14 CFR parts 91; AIM; FAA-H-8083-2, FAA-H-8083-3, FAA-H-8083-15, FAA-H-8083-16, FAA-H-8083-25
### Objective
To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with ATC clearances and procedures while operating solely by reference to instruments.
### Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates understanding of:
* IR.III.A.K1 Elements and procedures related to ATC clearances and pilot/controller responsibilities for departure, en route, and arrival phases of flight, including clearance void times.
* IR.III.A.K2 Pilot-in-Command (PIC) emergency authority.
* IR.III.A.K3 Lost communication procedures and procedures for flights outside of radar environments.
### Risk Management
The applicant is able to identify, assess, and mitigate risk associated with:
* IR.III.A.R1 Less than full understanding of an ATC clearance.
* IR.III.A.R2 Inappropriate, incomplete, or incorrect ATC clearances.
* IR.III.A.R3 ATC clearance inconsistent with aircraft performance or navigation capability.
* IR.III.A.R4 ATC clearance intended for other aircraft with similar call signs.
### Skills
The applicant exhibits the skill to:
* IR.III.A.S1 Correctly copy, read back, interpret, and comply with simulated or actual ATC clearances in a timely manner using standard phraseology as provided in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).
* IR.III.A.S2 Correctly set communication frequencies, navigation systems (identifying when appropriate), and transponder codes in compliance with the ATC clearance.
* IR.III.A.S3 Use the current and appropriate paper or electronic navigation publications.
* IR.III.A.S4 Intercept all courses, radials, and bearings appropriate to the procedure, route, or clearance in a timely manner.
* IR.III.A.S5 Maintain the applicable airspeed ±10 knots, headings ±10°, altitude ±100 feet; track a course, radial, or bearing within ¾-scale deflection of the course deviation indicator (CDI).
* IR.III.A.S6 Use single-pilot resource management (SRM) or crew resource management (CRM), as appropriate.
* IR.III.A.S7 Perform the appropriate checklist items relative to the phase of flight.
## Task B. Holding Procedures
### References
14 CFR part 91; AIM; FAA-H-8083-2, FAA-H-8083-3, FAA-H-8083-15, FAA-H-8083-16, FAA-H-8083-25
### Objective
To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with holding procedures solely by reference to instruments.
### Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates understanding of:
* IR.III.B.K1 Elements related to holding procedures, including reporting criteria, appropriate speeds, and recommended entry procedures for standard, nonstandard, published, and non-published holding patterns.
### Risk Management
The applicant is able to identify, assess, and mitigate risk associated with:
* IR.III.B.R1 Recalculating fuel reserves if assigned an unanticipated expect further clearance (EFC) time.
* IR.III.B.R2 Scenarios and circumstances that could result in minimum fuel or the need to declare an emergency.
* IR.III.B.R3 Scenarios that could lead to holding, including deteriorating weather at the planned destination.
* IR.III.B.R4 Holding entry and wind correction while holding.
### Skills
The applicant exhibits the skill to:
* IR.III.B.S1 Use an entry procedure appropriate for a standard, nonstandard, published, or non-published holding pattern.
* IR.III.B.S2 Change to the holding airspeed appropriate for the altitude when 3 minutes or less from, but prior to arriving at, the holding fix and set appropriate power as needed for fuel conservation.
* IR.III.B.S3 Recognize arrival at the holding fix and promptly initiate entry into the holding pattern.
* IR.III.B.S3a a. Comply with the holding pattern leg length and other restrictions, if applicable, associated with the holding pattern
* IR.III.B.S4 Maintain airspeed ±10 knots, altitude ±100 feet, selected headings within ±10°, and track a selected course, radial, or bearing within ¾-scale deflection of the course deviation indicator (CDI).
* IR.III.B.S5 Use proper wind correction procedures to maintain the desired pattern and to arrive over the fix as close as possible to a specified time.
* IR.III.B.S6 Use a multi-function display (MFD) and other graphical navigation displays, if installed, to monitor position in relation to the desired flightpath during holding.
* IR.III.B.S7 Comply with ATC reporting requirements and restrictions associated with the holding pattern.
* IR.III.B.S8 Use single-pilot resource management (SRM) or crew resource management (CRM), as appropriate.
