# IV. Flight by Reference to Instruments
## Task A. Instrument Flight
### References
FAA-H-8083-2, FAA-H-8083-3, FAA-H-8083-15, FAA-H-8083-16, FAA-H-8083-25
### Objective
To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with performing basic flight maneuvers solely by reference to instruments.
### Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates understanding of:
* IR.IV.A.K1 Elements related to attitude instrument flying during straight-and-level flight, climbs, turns, and descents while conducting various instrument flight procedures.
* IR.IV.A.K2 Interpretation, operation, and limitations of pitch, bank, and power instruments.
* IR.IV.A.K3 Normal and abnormal instrument indications and operations.
### Risk Management
The applicant is able to identify, assess, and mitigate risk associated with:
* IR.IV.A.R1 Situations that can affect physiology and degrade instrument cross-check.
* IR.IV.A.R2 Spatial disorientation and optical illusions.
* IR.IV.A.R3 Flying unfamiliar aircraft or operating with unfamiliar flight display systems and avionics.
### Skills
The applicant exhibits the skill to:
* IR.IV.A.S1 Maintain altitude ±100 feet during level flight, selected headings ±10°, airspeed ±10 knots, and bank angles ±5° during turns.
* IR.IV.A.S2 Use proper instrument cross-check and interpretation, and apply the appropriate pitch, bank, power, and trim corrections when applicable.
## Task B. Recovery from Unusual Flight Attitudes
### References
FAA-H-8083-2, FAA-H-8083-3, FAA-H-8083-15, FAA-H-8083-25; POH/AFM
### Objective
To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with recovering from unusual flight attitudes solely by reference to instruments.
### Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates understanding of:
* IR.IV.B.K1 Procedures for recovery from unusual attitudes in flight.
* IR.IV.B.K2 Prevention of unusual attitudes, including flight causal, physiological, and environmental factors, and system and equipment failures.
* IR.IV.B.K3 Procedures available to safely regain visual meteorological conditions (VMC) after flight into inadvertent instrument meteorological conditions or unintended instrument meteorological conditions (IIMC)/(UIMC).
* IR.IV.B.K4 Appropriate use of automation, if applicable.
### Risk Management
The applicant is able to identify, assess, and mitigate risk associated with:
* IR.IV.B.R1 Situations that could lead to loss of control in-flight (LOC-I) or unusual attitudes in-flight (e.g., stress, task saturation, inadequate instrument scan distractions, and spatial disorientation).
* IR.IV.B.R2 [Archived]
* IR.IV.B.R3 Operating envelope considerations.
* IR.IV.B.R4 Interpreting flight instruments.
* IR.IV.B.R5 Assessment of the unusual attitude.
* IR.IV.B.R6 Control input errors, inducing undesired aircraft attitudes.
* IR.IV.B.R7 Control application solely by reference to instruments.
* IR.IV.B.R8 Collision hazards.
* IR.IV.B.R9 Distractions, task prioritization, loss of situational awareness, or disorientation.
### Skills
The applicant exhibits the skill to:
* IR.IV.B.S1 Use proper instrument cross-check and interpretation to identify an unusual attitude (including both nose-high and nose-low) in flight, and apply the appropriate flight control, power input, and aircraft configuration in the correct sequence, to return to a stabilized level flight attitude.
* IR.IV.B.S2 Use single-pilot resource management (SRM) or crew resource management (CRM), as appropriate.
