# IV. Flight by Reference to Instruments
## Task A. Instrument Flight
### References
14 CFR part 61; FAA-8083-2, FAA-H-8083-15
### Objective
To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with performing basic instrument flight maneuvers solely by reference to instruments.
### Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates understanding of:
* IR.IV.A.K1 Elements related to attitude instrument flying during straight-and-level flight, climbs, turns, and descents while conducting various instrument flight procedures.
* IR.IV.A.K2 Interpretation, operation, and limitations of pitch, bank, and power instruments.
* IR.IV.A.K3 Normal and abnormal instrument indications and operations.
### Risk Management
The applicant demonstrates the ability to identify, assess and mitigate risks, encompassing:
* IR.IV.A.R1 Situations that can affect physiology and degrade instrument cross-check.
* IR.IV.A.R2 Spatial disorientation and optical illusions.
* IR.IV.A.R3 Flying unfamiliar airplanes, or operating with unfamiliar flight display systems and avionics.
### Skills
The applicant demonstrates the ability to:
* IR.IV.A.S1 Maintain altitude ±100 feet during level flight, selected headings ±10°, airspeed ±10 knots, and bank angles ±5° during turns.
* IR.IV.A.S2 Use proper instrument cross-check and interpretation, and apply the appropriate pitch, bank, power, and trim corrections when applicable.
## Task B. Recovery from Unusual Flight Attitudes
### References
14 CFR part 61; FAA-H-8083-15
### Objective
To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with recovering from unusual flight attitudes solely by reference to instruments.
### Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates understanding of:
* IR.IV.B.K1 Procedures for recovery from unusual flight attitudes.
* IR.IV.B.K2 Unusual flight attitude causal factors, including physiological factors, system and equipment failures, and environmental factors.
### Risk Management
The applicant demonstrates the ability to identify, assess and mitigate risks, encompassing:
* IR.IV.B.R1 Situations that could lead to loss of control or unusual flight attitudes (e.g., stress, task saturation, and distractions).
* IR.IV.B.R2 Failure to recognize an unusual flight attitude and follow the proper recovery procedure.
* IR.IV.B.R3 Exceeding the operating envelope during the recovery.
### Skills
The applicant demonstrates the ability to:
* IR.IV.B.S1 Use proper instrument cross-check and interpretation to identify an unusual attitude (including both nose-high and nose-low), and apply the appropriate pitch, bank, and power corrections, in the correct sequence, to return to a stabilized level flight attitude.
