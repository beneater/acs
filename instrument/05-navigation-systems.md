# V. Navigation Systems
## Task A. Intercepting and Tracking Navigational Systems and Arcs
### References
14 CFR parts 61, 91; FAA-H-8083-15, FAA-H-8083-16; AFM; AIM. Note: The evaluator must reference the manufacturer’s equipment supplement(s) as necessary for appropriate limitations, procedures, etc.
### Objective
To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with intercepting and tracking navigation aids and arcs solely by reference to instruments.
### Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates understanding of:
* IR.V.A.K1 Ground-based navigation (orientation, course determination, equipment, tests and regulations) including procedures for intercepting and tracking courses and arcs.
* IR.V.A.K2 Satellite-based navigation (orientation, course determination, equipment, tests and regulations, interference, appropriate use of databases, RAIM, and WAAS) including procedures for intercepting and tracking courses and arcs.
### Risk Management
The applicant demonstrates the ability to identify, assess and mitigate risks, encompassing:
* IR.V.A.R1 Failure to manage automated navigation and autoflight systems.
* IR.V.A.R2 Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management.
* IR.V.A.R3 Limitations of the navigation system in use.
### Skills
The applicant demonstrates the ability to:
* IR.V.A.S1 Tune and correctly identify the navigation facility/program the navigation system and verify system accuracy as appropriate for the equipment installed in the airplane.
* IR.V.A.S2 Determine airplane position relative to the navigational facility or waypoint.
* IR.V.A.S3 Set and correctly orient to the course to be intercepted.
* IR.V.A.S4 Intercept the specified course at appropriate angle, inbound to or outbound from a navigational facility or waypoint.
* IR.V.A.S5 Maintain airspeed ±10 knots, altitude ±100 feet, and selected headings ±5°.
* IR.V.A.S6 Apply proper correction to maintain a course, allowing no more than ¾-scale deflection of the CDI. If a DME arc is selected, maintain that arc ±1 nautical mile.
* IR.V.A.S7 Recognize navigational system or facility failure, and when required, report the failure to ATC.
* IR.V.A.S8 Use an MFD and other graphical navigation displays, if installed, to monitor position, track wind drift, and to maintain situational awareness.
* IR.V.A.S9 Use the autopilot to make appropriate course intercepts, if installed.
## Task B. Departure, En Route, and Arrival Operations
### References
14 CFR parts 61, 91; FAA-H-8083-15, FAA-H-8083-16; AC 91-74; AFM; AIM
### Objective
To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with IFR departure, en route, and arrival operations solely by reference to instruments. Note: See Appendix 7: Aircraft, Equipment, and Operational Requirements & Limitations for related considerations.
### Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates understanding of:
* IR.V.B.K1 Elements related to ATC routes, including departure procedures (DPs) and associated climb gradients; arrival procedures (STARs) and associated constraints.
* IR.V.B.K2 Pilot/controller responsibilities, communication procedures, and ATC services available to pilots.
### Risk Management
The applicant demonstrates the ability to identify, assess and mitigate risks, encompassing:
* IR.V.B.R1 Failure to communicate with ATC or follow published procedures.
* IR.V.B.R2 Failure to recognize limitations of traffic avoidance equipment.
* IR.V.B.R3 Failure to use see and avoid techniques when possible.
### Skills
The applicant demonstrates the ability to:
* IR.V.B.S1 Select, identify (as necessary) and use the appropriate communication and navigation facilities associated with the proposed flight.
* IR.V.B.S2 Perform the appropriate airplane checklist items relative to the phase of flight.
* IR.V.B.S3 Use the current and appropriate paper or electronic navigation publications..
* IR.V.B.S4 Establish two-way communications with the proper controlling agency, use proper phraseology, and comply in a timely manner with all ATC instructions and airspace restrictions, and exhibit adequate knowledge of communication failure procedures.
* IR.V.B.S5 Intercept all courses, radials, and bearings appropriate to the procedure, route, or clearance in a timely manner.
* IR.V.B.S6 Comply with all applicable charted procedures.
* IR.V.B.S7 Maintain airspeed ±10 knots, altitude ±100 feet, and selected headings ±10°, and apply proper correction to maintain a course allowing no more than ¾-scale deflection of the CDI.
* IR.V.B.S8 Update/interpret weather in flight.
* IR.V.B.S9 Explain and use flight deck displays of digital weather and aeronautical information, as applicable.
* IR.V.B.S10 Demonstrate SRM.
