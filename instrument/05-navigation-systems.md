## Task A. Intercepting and Tracking Navigational Systems and DME Arcs
### References
14 CFR part 91; AIM; FAA-H-8083-2, FAA-H-8083-3, FAA-H-8083-15, FAA-H-8083-16, FAA-H-8083-25; POH/AFM
### Objective
To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with intercepting and tracking navigation aids and arcs solely by reference to instruments.  Note: The evaluator should reference the manufacturer’s equipment supplement(s) as necessary for appropriate limitations, procedures, etc.  Note: See Appendix 3: Aircraft, Equipment, and Operational Requirements & Limitations for information related to this Task.
### Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates understanding of:
* IR.V.A.K1 Ground-based navigation (orientation, course determination, equipment, tests, and regulations), including procedures for intercepting and tracking courses and arcs.
* IR.V.A.K2 Satellite-based navigation (orientation, course determination, equipment, tests, regulations, interference, appropriate use of databases, Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), and Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)), including procedures for intercepting and tracking courses and arcs.
### Risk Management
The applicant is able to identify, assess, and mitigate risk associated with:
* IR.V.A.R1 Management of automated navigation and autoflight systems.
* IR.V.A.R2 Distractions, task prioritization, loss of situational awareness, or disorientation.
* IR.V.A.R3 Limitations of the navigation system in use.
### Skills
The applicant exhibits the skill to:
* IR.V.A.S1 Tune and identify the navigation facility/program the navigation system and verify system accuracy as appropriate for the equipment installed in the aircraft.
* IR.V.A.S2 Determine aircraft position relative to the navigational facility or waypoint.
* IR.V.A.S3 Set and orient to the course to be intercepted.
* IR.V.A.S4 Intercept the specified course at appropriate angle, inbound to or outbound from a navigational facility or waypoint.
* IR.V.A.S5 Maintain airspeed ±10 knots, altitude ±100 feet, and selected headings ±5°.
* IR.V.A.S6 Apply proper correction to maintain a course, allowing no more than ¾-scale deflection of the course deviation indicator (CDI). If a distance measuring equipment (DME) arc is selected, maintain that arc ±1 nautical mile.
* IR.V.A.S7 Recognize navigational system or facility failure, and when required, report the failure to air traffic control (ATC).
* IR.V.A.S8 Use a multi-function display (MFD) and other graphical navigation displays, if installed, to monitor position, track wind drift, and to maintain situational awareness.
* IR.V.A.S9 At the discretion of the evaluator, use the autopilot to make appropriate course intercepts, if installed.
* IR.V.A.S10 Use single-pilot resource management (SRM) or crew resource management (CRM), as appropriate.

### Objective
To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with IFR departure, en route, and arrival operations solely by reference to instruments.
### Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates understanding of:
* IR.V.B.K1 Elements related to ATC routes, including departure procedures (DPs) and associated climb gradients; standard terminal arrival (STAR) procedures and associated constraints.
* IR.V.B.K2 Pilot/controller responsibilities, communication procedures, and ATC services available to pilots.
### Risk Management
The applicant is able to identify, assess, and mitigate risk associated with:
* IR.V.B.R1 ATC communications and compliance with published procedures.
* IR.V.B.R2 Limitations of traffic avoidance equipment.
* IR.V.B.R3 Responsibility to use "see and avoid" techniques when possible.
### Skills
The applicant exhibits the skill to:
* IR.V.B.S1 Select, identify (as necessary) and use the appropriate communication and navigation facilities associated with the proposed flight.
* IR.V.B.S2 Perform the appropriate checklist items relative to the phase of flight.
* IR.V.B.S3 Use the current and appropriate paper or electronic navigation publications.
* IR.V.B.S4 Establish two-way communications with the proper controlling agency, use proper phraseology, and comply in a timely manner with all ATC instructions and airspace restrictions.
* IR.V.B.S5 Intercept all courses, radials, and bearings appropriate to the procedure, route, or clearance in a timely manner.
* IR.V.B.S6 Comply with all applicable charted procedures.
* IR.V.B.S7 Maintain airspeed ±10 knots, altitude ±100 feet, and selected headings ±10°, and apply proper correction to maintain a course allowing no more than ¾-scale deflection of the course deviation indicator (CDI).
* IR.V.B.S8 Update/interpret weather in flight.
* IR.V.B.S9 Use displays of digital weather and aeronautical information, as applicable to maintain situational awareness.
* IR.V.B.S10 Use single-pilot resource management (SRM) or crew resource management (CRM), as appropriate.
