* PA.V.A.K2 Aerodynamics associated with steep turns, including:
* PA.V.A.K2a a. Maintaining coordinated flight

* PA.V.A.K2c c. Maneuvering speed, including the impact of weight changes
* PA.V.A.K2d d. Load factor and accelerated stalls
* PA.V.A.K2e e. Rate and radius of turn
### Risk Management
The applicant is able to identify, assess, and mitigate risk associated with:
* PA.V.A.R1 Division of attention between aircraft control and orientation.
* PA.V.A.R2 Collision hazards.
* PA.V.A.R3 Low altitude maneuvering, including stall, spin, or controlled flight into terrain (CFIT).
* PA.V.A.R4 Distractions, task prioritization, loss of situational awareness, or disorientation.
* PA.V.A.R5 Uncoordinated flight.
### Skills
The applicant exhibits the skill to:
* PA.V.A.S1 Clear the area.
* PA.V.A.S2 Establish the manufacturer's recommended airspeed; or if one is not available, an airspeed not to exceed the maneuvering speed (VA).
* PA.V.A.S3 Roll into a coordinated 360° steep turn with approximately a 45° bank.
* PA.V.A.S4 Perform the Task in the opposite direction, as specified by evaluator.
* PA.V.A.S5 Maintain the entry altitude ±100 feet, airspeed ±10 knots, bank ±5°, and roll out on the entry heading ±10°.
## Task B. Ground Reference Maneuvers
### References
14 CFR part 61; FAA-H-8083-2, FAA-H-8083-3, FAA-H-8083-25
### Objective
To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with ground reference maneuvering which may include a rectangular course, S-turns, and turns around a point. Note: The evaluator selects at least one ground reference maneuver for the applicant to demonstrate.
### Knowledge
The applicant demonstrates understanding of:
* PA.V.B.K1 Purpose of ground reference maneuvers.
* PA.V.B.K2 Effects of wind on ground track and relation to a ground reference.
* PA.V.B.K3 Effects of bank angle and groundspeed on rate and radius of turn.
* PA.V.B.K4 Relationship of rectangular course to airport traffic pattern.
### Risk Management
The applicant is able to identify, assess, and mitigate risk associated with:
* PA.V.B.R1 Division of attention between aircraft control and orientation.
* PA.V.B.R2 Collision hazards.
* PA.V.B.R3 Low altitude maneuvering, including stall, spin, or controlled flight into terrain (CFIT).
* PA.V.B.R4 Distractions, task prioritization, loss of situational awareness, or disorientation.
* PA.V.B.R5 Uncoordinated flight.
### Skills
The applicant exhibits the skill to:
* PA.V.B.S1 Clear the area.
* PA.V.B.S2 Select a suitable ground reference area, line, or point as appropriate.
* PA.V.B.S3 Plan the maneuver:
* PA.V.B.S3a a. Rectangular course: enter a left or right pattern, 600 to 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL) at an appropriate distance from the selected reference area, 45° to the downwind leg
* PA.V.B.S3b b. S-turns: enter perpendicular to the selected reference line, 600 to 1,000 feet AGL at an appropriate distance from the selected reference area
* PA.V.B.S3c c. Turns around a point: enter at an appropriate distance from the reference point, 600 to 1,000 feet AGL at an appropriate distance from the selected reference area
* PA.V.B.S4 Apply adequate wind-drift correction during straight and turning flight to maintain a constant ground track around a rectangular reference area, or to maintain a constant radius turn on each side of a selected reference line or point.
* PA.V.B.S5 If performing S-Turns, reverse the turn directly over the selected reference line; if performing turns around a point, complete turns in either direction, as specified by the evaluator.
* PA.V.B.S6 Divide attention between airplane control, traffic avoidance and the ground track while maintaining coordinated flight.
* PA.V.B.S7 Maintain altitude ±100 feet; maintain airspeed ±10 knots.
